# Fruad_Detection-Self-Organizing_Map-Artificial_Neural_Network



# Mega Case Study - Make a Hybrid Deep Learning Model



# Part 1 - Identify the Frauds with the Self-Organizing Map
# then in part 2, label the customers who are frauds, 
#    feed all customer features and classifications (fraud or not) to train Artificial Neural Network 
#    to predict the probability of fraud classification based on customer features

#run the code in mega_case_study.py
